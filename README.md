# DA-Taquillas

This project is an initiative by the Student Council for managing locker rentals.

## Usage Guide

To ensure smooth setup and avoid issues with Node modules, they are not included by default. However, for proper functionality, it's recommended to run the following commands:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express mysql2 body-parser
```

These commands will initialize the project and install the necessary modules for the application to work correctly.

Por otro lado para el apartado de la base de datos he decidido usar phpmyadmin y mysql para la correcta gestion de la base de datos
